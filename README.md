## 🎨 Design Principles

This bot follows the **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** principle:

- **Modular Code** - Each feature in its own module
- **Consistent Formatting** - Uniform Discord markdown and embeds
- **Clear Error Messages** - Users always know what went wrong
- **Type Safety** - Enums and type hints throughout
- **Database-driven** - No hardcoded configuration

## 🔧 Development

### Adding a New Command

1. Choose the appropriate cog in `cogs/`
2. Use the `@app_commands.command()` decorator
3. Add permission checks using utilities from `utils/permissions.py`
4. Use formatting utilities from `utils/formatting.py`
5. Handle errors with `handle_interaction_error()`
6. Log important actions with `db_helper.log()`

### Adding a New Voting Type

1. Add to `VotingType` enum in `utils/enums.py`
2. Add configuration to `VOTING_TYPE_CONFIG`
3. Add choice to `/propose` command in `cogs/propose.py`
